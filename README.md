# NewsWCL50
NewsWCL50 is the first, open access evaluation dataset for methods seeking to identify bias by word choice and labeling.

The dataset consists (besides some additional files such as the readme you are currently reading) of two files:

| Name        | Description  | 
| ------------- |-------------|
| `Annotations.csv` | Contains all annotations that we coded during the manual, deductive content analysis. The start and end columns represent the annotation's position as to the document in number of tokens. |
| `Codebook.pdf` | The codebook used to conduct the final deductive content analysis. |
